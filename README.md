# Project to check multiple choice test with opencv and python


In this project we used four library, including opencv, numpy, regex and pandas to analyze the photos ( the students' anwser) to find the right anwser, wrong anwser and the students' result.

Opencv:
   
       pip install opencv-python
       conda install opencv (if you use conda)

        pip install numpy
        conda install numpy (if you use conda)
        
Pandas:
        
        pip install pandas
