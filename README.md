# About the project:

This project helped students practice to use 4 library, including opencv, numpy, regex and pandas. We can practice a lot to analyze the photos, statistics. And we can optomize code better. Moreover, with this project we can study a lot to improve coding skills and how to use the library better.

## Data:

In this project, we used 50 photos-this is the student result in the answer sheet. You can find it in folder "Student".

Example data:


<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="33%" src="https://github.com/HarryxDD/OpticalMarkRecognition/blob/main/student/2000101_NguyenVanAn_3A.png"> 
</p>

With these datas, we compares the students' answers with the our answer to find the students' result. Our anwser in folder "answer".

## Usage:
```
1/ Move to folder: "OpticalMarkRecognition" (cd OpticalMarkRecognition)

2/ Start with file :"Student_info.py" to  handle the infomation of student'answer.

3/ Continue with file:"answer.py" to analyze the root answer.

4/ Finally, we use file:"student.py" to check the right answer, wrong answer, and the final score of each student. All of the information will be display in the terminal.

5/ We can read file csv in folder:"csv_files".
```
