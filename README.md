In this project we used four library, including opencv, numpy, regex and pandas to analyze the photos ( the students' anwser) to find the right anwser, wrong anwser and the students' result.




## Install library:

Opencv:
   
       pip install opencv-python
       conda install opencv (if you use conda)
       
Numpy:
 
        pip install numpy
        conda install numpy (if you use conda)
        
Pandas:
        
        pip install pandas
        conda install pandas (if you use conda)
        
Regex:
   
        pip install regex
        conda install regex (if you use conda)
        


      


## Data:

In this project, we used 50 photos-this is the student result in the answer sheet. You can find it in folder "Student".

Example data:

<img src="https://github.com/HarryxDD/OpticalMarkRecognition/blob/main/student/2000101_NguyenVanAn_3A.png" width="500" height="600"> 

With these datas, we compares the students' answers with the our answer to find the students' result. Our anwser in folder "answer".


## Usage:
```
1/ Move to folder: "OpticalMarkRecognition" (cd OpticalMarkRecognition)

2/ Start with file :"Student_info.py" to  handle the infomation of student'answer.

3/ Continue with file:"answer.py" to analyze the root answer.

4/ Finally, we use file:"student.py" to check the right answer, wrong answer, and the final score of each student.
